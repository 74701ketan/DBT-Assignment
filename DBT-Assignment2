Q3->  Why isn't it possible to see the first five rows of table?
Ans-> when you insert into a table ,rows of table are not stored sequentially.
      Whenever MySQL finds free space it will store there.
      The Reason Why MySQl does this, to speed up the insert statement.
      When you Select from a table, the order of rows in output depends on row address.
      hence it is not possible to see first N number of rows.
